# Fraud Reporting DAPP

This is a project in Solidity that intends to create a decentralized application in Ethereum. The application is going to be a Fraud Reporting application. The idea is that everyone can report a Fraud website and get ether as bounty for their findings. Companies that are interested in finding out the fraud websites and taking them down are going to create bounties for fraud websites. Users can then create a Fraud Report and point to a specific Bounty that they would like to claim as reward. If the company finds that a Fraud Report contains a url that points to a fraud website, then it can reward the bounty to the creator of that Fraud Report.
It is my first project using Solidity and Ethereum. <3
I used Solidity, Truffle, Ganache and Remix while developing the smart contract.
